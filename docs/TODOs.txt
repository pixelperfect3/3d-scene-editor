Sid: 1) menu, 2) bounding-box
Rotate camera when dragging an object "past" the edge of the screen.


== Bugs ==
Mouse click doesn't de-select (but it does turn off bounding box).
VRPN doesn't like 2 WiiMotes.
Don't let models hide behind house.
Don't let models outside of the lot.
2 IR points with nothing selected => Crash!!!
Right-clicking => Crash!!!
