#summary How to download, install, etc.

=== Download ===
  # Get a SVN checkout of trunk.
  # Download the Ogre Debug and Release DLLs 7-zip archives from our Downloads tab.


=== Installation ===
  # Extract the Ogre DLLs directly into the src/VEProj4 folder.
  # Open the MSVC solution src/vrpn/vrpn.sln (If you're having compat issues, try vrpn.dsw).
  # Build both Release and Debug versions of the following VRPN projects: quatlib, vrpn, vrpn_server, vrpndll.
  # Open the MSVC solution src/VEProj4 (should be VC++ 2005).
  # Build the project in Release mode.
  # I didn't include any of the skybox or models, so good luck executing it.


=== Other issues ===
  # You probably need to set the OGRE_SRC or OGRE_SDK variable to your Ogre build directory.
  # And you probably want to use Joon's patched Ogre binaries in said directories.
